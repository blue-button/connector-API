SYNOPSIS
--------
I/O Docs is a live interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter
levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed from this interface, which are then proxied through the I/O Docs server with payload data cleanly formatted (pretty-printed if JSON or XML). Basic HTML text tags are enabled in the JSON schema.

You can find the latest version here: [https://github.com/mashery/iodocs](https://github.com/mashery/iodocs)

However, we recommend that you install I/O Docs with *npm*, the Node package manager. See instructions below.

BUILD/RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------
1. Node.js - server-side JS engine
2. npm - node package manager
3. Redis - key+value storage engine

Note: Node and some of the modules require compiler (like gcc). If you are on a Mac, you will need to install XCode. If you're on Linux, you'll need to install build-essentials, or something equivalent.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR NODE, NPM & REDIS
-----------------------------------------------
1. Node.js - [https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)
2. npm (Node package manager) - [https://github.com/isaacs/npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm)
3. Redis - [http://redis.io/download](http://redis.io/download)

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR I/O DOCS
--------------------------------------
From the command line type in:
<pre>  git clone http://github.com/mashery/iodocs.git
  cd iodocs
  npm install
</pre>


### Node Module Dependencies
These will be automatically installed when you use any of the above *npm* installation methods above.

1. [express](http://expressjs.com/) - framework
2. [oauth](https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth) - oauth library
3. [redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) - connector to Redis
3. [connect-redis](https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis) - Redis session store
4. [querystring](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring) - used to parse query string
5. [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - the view engine
6. [supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) - restart node upon an error or changed javascript file

Note: hashlib is no longer a required module -- we're using the internal crypto module for signatures and digests.

RUNNING I/O DOCS
----------------
**Create your config** file by copying the default config:

```
cp config.json.sample config.json
```
The defaults will work, but feel free to change them.

**Run a Redis instance:**

```
redis-server
```

**Start I/O Docs**:

```
npm start (*nix, Mac OSX)
npm run-script startwin (Windows)
```


**Point your browser** to: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

CONFIGURING API DEFINITION LOCATION
-----------------------------------
API definitions are, by default, stored in `./public/data/` and described by `./public/data/apiconfig.json`. This can
be overridden in `config.json` by setting the `"apiConfigDir"` property.


BASIC AUTH FOR SERVER
---------------------
Enabling HTTP basic authentication on the server is simple. By default, the username and password values are empty ("").

1. Open up *config.json*
2. Navigate down to the *basicAuth* object
3. Add values for username and password within the object


QUICK API CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
-------------------------------
Adding an API to the I/O Docs configuration is relatively simple.

First, append the new top-level service information to the `./public/data/apiconfig.json` file.

Example:
   
```js
"lowercaseapi": {
    "name": "Lower Case API",
    "protocol": "http",
    "baseURL": "api.lowercase.sample.com",
    "publicPath": "/v1",
    "auth": "key",
    "keyParam": "api_key_var_name",
    "headers": {
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

Add the file `./public/data/lowercaseapi.json` to define the API.

Example:
   
```js
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "name": "Resource Group A",
            "methods": [
                {
                    "MethodName": "Method A1",
                    "Synopsis": "Grabs information from the A1 data set",
                    "HTTPMethod": "GET",
                    "URI": "/a1/grab",
                    "RequiresOAuth": "N",
                    "parameters": [
                        {
                            "Name": "param_1_name",
                            "Required": "Y",
                            "Default": "",
                            "Type": "string",
                            "Description": "Description of the first parameter."
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "MethodName": "Method A1 User",
                    "Synopsis": "Grabs information from the A1 data set for a specific user",
                    "HTTPMethod": "GET",
                    "URI": "/a1/grab/:userId",
                    "RequiresOAuth": "N",
                    "parameters": [
                        {
                            "Name": "param_1_name",
                            "Required": "Y",
                            "Default": "",
                            "Type": "string",
                            "Description": "Description of the first parameter."
                        },
                        {
                            "Name": "userId",
                            "Required": "Y",
                            "Default": "",
                            "Type": "string",
                            "Description": "The userId parameter that is in the URI."
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

By default the parameters are added to the query string. But if the URI contains a named variable, it will substitute the value in the path.

TOP-LEVEL SERVICE CONFIG DETAILS - apiconfig.json
-------------------------------------------------
The *apiconfig.json* file contains high-level information about an API.

### Example #1 - Explanation of each field in an example API config that uses basic key authentication:

```js
"lower": {
    "name": "My API",
    "protocol": "http",
    "baseURL": "api.lowercase.sample.com",
    "publicPath": "/v1",
    "auth": "key",
    "keyParam": "api_key_var_name",
    "headers": {
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

Line:

1. Handle of the API. It is used to pull up the client 
   interface in the URL:

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:3000/lower

2. "name" key value is a string that holds the name
    of the API that is used in the Jade template output.

3. "protocol" key value is either *http* or *https*

4. "baseURL" key value is the host name of
    the API calls (should not include protocol)

5. "publicPath" key value is the full path prefix prepended
    to all method URIs. This value often includes the version
    in RESTful APIs.

    Ex: "/v1"

    In the Example #3 below, there is also "privatePath"
    which is used for endpoints behind protected resources.

6. "auth" key value is the auth method. Valid values can be:

         "key" - simple API key in the URI
         "oauth1" - OAuth 1.0/1.0a
         "" - no authentication

7. "keyParam" key value is name of the query parameter that
    is added to an API request when the "auth" key value from
    (5) is set to "key".

8. "headers" object contains key value pairs of HTTP headers
    that will be sent for each request for API. These are
    static key/value pairs.

12. Closing curly-bracket ;)

### Example #2 - Explanation of each field in an example API config that uses basic key authentication with signatures (signed call).

```js
"upper": {
   "name": "Upper API",
   "protocol": "http",
   "baseURL": "api.upper.sample.com",
   "publicPath": "/v3",
   "auth": "key",
   "keyParam": "api_key_var_name",
   "signature": {
      "type": "signed_md5",
      "sigParam": "sig",
      "digest": "hex"  
   }
}
```

Line:

1. Handle of the API. It is used to pull up the client 
   interface in the URL:

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:3000/upper

2. "name" key value is a string that holds the name
    of the API that is used in the Jade template output.

3. "protocol" key value is either *http* or *https*

4. "baseURL" key value is the host name of
    the API calls (should not include protocol)

5. "publicPath" key value is the full path prefix prepended
    to all method URIs. This value often includes the version
    in RESTful APIs.

    Ex: "/v3"

    In the Example #3 below, there is also "privatePath"
    which is used for endpoints behind protected resources.

6. "auth" key value is the auth method. Valid values can be:

         "key" - simple API key in the URI
         "oauth1" - OAuth 1.0/1.0a
         "" - no authentication

7. "keyParam" key value is the name of the query parameter that
    is added to an API request when the "auth" key value from
    (5) is set to "key"

8. "signature" is a JSON object that contains the details about
   the API call signing requirements. The signature routine coded
   in app.js is a hash of the string concatenation of API key, 
   API key secret and timestamp (epoch).

9. "type" key value is either *signed_md5* or *signed_sha256*.
   More signature methods are available with crypto.js, but have
   not been included in the code as options.

10. "sigParam" key value is the name of the query parameter that
    is added to an API request that holds the digital signature.

11. "digest" key value is the digest algorithm that is used.
    Values can be *hex*, *base64* or *binary*.

12. Closing curly-bracket for the "signature" object

13. Closing curly bracket for main object.

### Example #3 - Twitter API config that uses 3-legged OAuth

```js
"twitter": {
    "name": "Twitter API",

7. "booleanTrueVal" key value is the default value for
    true Boolean values that are sent in API requests.
    Some APIs are designed to accept a wide variety
    of true derivatives, but some are very strict about
    this value.

    Ex: "true", "TRUE", "True", "t", "T", "1", etc.
    Default: "true"

8. "booleanFalseVal" key value is the default value for
    false Boolean values that are sent in API requests.

Additional Note: All redirect URIs for the Foursquare API & your 
Foursqare app must be set through the Foursquare developer site. 
For the iodocs Foursquare API test these URIs are :
"http://localhost:3000/foursquare", "http://localhost:3000/oauth2Success/foursquare"

For the Rdio API test, beta access to their new API is necessary. 
The site for the beta API is: "http://www.rdio.com/developers/"



API-LEVEL CONFIG DETAILS
========================
For every API that is configured in *apiconfig.json* a JSON config file must exist.
You should look at the *./public/data/* directory for examples.  

### Example #1 - Explanation of each field in an example API-level configuration

```js

   "name":"User Resources",
   "methods":[
      {
